Task 1 -- Analysis
------------------

### Subtask A -- Identifying Use Case

* __Identify and document _two_ use cases__.
  * Specify:
    * Initiation
    * Pre- and post-conditions
    * The primary flow
    * Some additional ones

  * Describe the flows using activity diagrams.

* Write down your own reflections in about 100 words, on:
  * Identifying use cases
  * Documenting use cases


### Subtask B -- Robustness Diagram

* Create robustness diagrams for the use cases you identified in task A. 
* Write about 100 words on your experience using robustness diagrams.


### Subtask C -- Use Case Realization

* Show use case realizations with sequence diagrams for:
  * The use case "List Books" 
  * The use case "Delete Book.

* Write about 100 words of reflections on use case realisations.


Task 2 -- Design
----------------

* Design the logic to fetch books in XML format 

  * After reading the XML file it should be converted into objects in the
    running system and lastly translated into JSON for the web browser.

  * Use suitable UML diagrams to describe your solution (i.e. not code). 

  * Identify objects used in this and what messages they are sending, and when. 

* Write about 100 words of reflections on use case realisations.



Task 3 -- Implementation
------------------------

* Take the design you created in task 2 and implement it in the system. 

* Implement Delete Book without first designing it. 

* Describe your reflections on the two approaches in about 100 words.


Include in the submission
-------------------------
The following should be included in the submission that you hand in via Moodle:

* Suitable diagrams; use case, activity, robustness, sequence
* Design with diagram and description
* Implementation (/src for Java and /app for Node.js)
* Report with all personal reflections
* Time log
